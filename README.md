# Cereal ü•£

Cereal is an experimental scripting language interpreter written in Rust. This project serves as a learning exercise to understand language implementation and Rust.

## Installation

You can download the latest binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/michaelrausch/cereal/releases).

## Usage

Run a Cereal script:
```bash
./cereal script.cereal
```

If no script is specified, it will look for `script.cereal` in the current directory.

## Language Features

Cereal is a simple scripting language (currently in development) that supports:
- Basic command execution
- Library function calls
- Input/output operations

## Sample Program
```
-- Constants Section
DEF planet Earth
DEF yes y
DEF github_link https://github.com/michaelrausch
DEF youtube_link https://youtube.com/michaelrausch

-- Functions Section    
FN print_hello_world DO
    PRINT Name?
    INPUT name
    PRINT Hello, $name! Welcome to planet $planet!
ENDFN

FN ask_commit_changes DO 
    PRINT Commit changes? (y/n)
    INPUT commit_changes

    -- Check if the user said yes
    IF $commit_changes IS $yes
        PRINT "Commiting changes"
        -- Library methods can (currently) be called
        -- by using the LIBCALL keyword. Arguments 
        -- are passed in registers.
        MOV r0 status
        MOV r1 .
        LIBCALL git
        PRINT $exec_stdout
    ENDIF
ENDFN

FN do_a_http_request DO 
    MOV r0 https://mkl.gg/
    LIBCALL httpget

    IF $http_get_body CONTAINS $github_link 
        PRINT Website contains my github link
    ENDIF

    IF $http_get_body NOTCONTAINS $youtube_link
        ABORT Website does not contain my youtube link
    ENDIF
ENDFN

FN do_a_http_request_but_with_macros DO 
    -- Macros added in 1.0.8
    !httpget https://mkl.gg/
    -- this will expand to:
    -- MOV r0 https://mkl.gg/
    -- LIBCALL httpget

    IF $http_get_body CONTAINS $github_link 
        PRINT Website contains my github link
    ENDIF

    IF $http_get_body NOTCONTAINS $youtube_link
        ABORT Website does not contain my youtube link
    ENDIF
ENDFN

-- Main Section
CALL print_hello_world
CALL ask_commit_changes
CALL do_a_http_request

```

## Language Syntax

### Constants
```
DEF <name> <value>
```
Constants can be used in expressions by prefixing them with `$`

### Functions 
```
FN <name> DO
    ...
ENDFN

CALL <name>
```

### IF
```
IF <a> IS/NOT/CONTAINS/NOTCONTAINS <b>
    ...
ENDIF
```

Condition must equal TRUE


### EQ / NEQ
```
EQ <left> <right>
NEQ <left> <right>
```

EQ and NEQ store the result in the `eq_result` register.
Note: probably not needed now that we can do better comparisons within IF statements.

### MOV
```
MOV <register> <value>
```
Values stored in registers are used as arguments for library / VM calls.

### LIBCALL
```
LIBCALL <name>
```
Calls a library function. You can pass arguments in registers.

### INPUT
```
INPUT <variable>
```
Reads user input and stores it in the specified variable.

### ABORT
```
ABORT <message>
```
Aborts the program with the specified message.

### PRINT
```
PRINT <value>
```
Prints a value to the console.

### EXEC
``` 
EXEC <command>
```
Executes a command on the host machine.
