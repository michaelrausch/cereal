# Cereal ü•£

Cereal is an experimental scripting language interpreter written in Rust. This project serves as a learning exercise to understand language implementation and Rust.

## Installation

You can download the latest binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/yourusername/cereal/releases).

## Usage

Run a Cereal script:
```bash
./cereal script.cereal
```

If no script is specified, it will look for `script.cereal` in the current directory.

## Language Features

Cereal is a simple scripting language (currently in development) that supports:
- Basic command execution
- Library function calls
- Input/output operations

## Sample Program
```
DEF planet Earth
DEF yes y

FN print_hello_world DO
    PRINT Name?
    INPUT name
    PRINT Hello, $name! Welcome to planet $planet!
ENDFN

FN ask_commit_changes DO 
    PRINT Commit changes? (y/n)
ENDFN

-- Print a hello world message
CALL print_hello_world

-- Ask if we should commit changes
CALL ask_commit_changes
INPUT commit_changes

-- Check if the user said yes
EQ $commit_changes $yes

IF $eq_result
    -- Library methods can (currently) be called
    -- by using the LIBCALL keyword. Arguments 
    -- are passed in registers.
    MOV r0 commit
    MOV r1 -m "Changes"
    LIBCALL git
ENDIF

```

```
